***first day***

1. I create new .Html file which is (index ) also i create a style.css file to style my page .
2. Create form in index.html to get the data from user in inputs fields .
3. Used function to give me random number for id.
4. Create a app.js file and create render method to render the output in table .
(the output will be what the user insert on the form ).
5. Used addEventListener to the form so when press submit button which is (save) the data of the form will create a new row with the data inside the table.
